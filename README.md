# hello-world
First repository

I have now updated the README to include my intended purpose for this iniital repository. 
I'm just trying to learn how to use GitHub by following the Hello World GitHub Guide.

These additional sentences are post-creation of the branch readme-edits. It's been suggested I should write about myself but I'm not going to do that, and no one can really make me do that. 

Goodbye!
